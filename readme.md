This project is the *eperHelper*.
It was designed in 2016-2017 as a tool *to assist Hungarian lawyers in electronic court procedures* in Hungary, including 

a) use of a custom XML-based form filling software called √ÅNYK (General Form Filler) with roots dating back to 1998;

b) storing master data for clients, opposing parties, lawyers, other entities and minimum case data (number and court);

c) using an electronic signature creation tool developed by Microsec (eSzigno automated version, XSign4All, not included in the repository);

d) facilitating upload of documents to "perkapu" (a special gateway for e-court communications, no longer available);

e) archival and extracting of files, use of encryption keys for documents etc.

The main reason for the creation was to facilitate the use of the very user unfriendly processes in electronic court procedures that were mandatory for lawyers to use from 1st July 2016.

The tool was available via a webshop, and upon payment by card, a unique registration code for that particular machine was issued (copy protection was required because of the signature module), with support provided by an IT company (Arconsult). The tool was discontinued after 6 months due to the lack of commercial interest (39 licenses bought at 16 900 HUF+VAT/each, cca. 50 euro/each).

Deleted Microsoft Webdriver and Gecko (for Chrome) that were used in browser-based automation for using the "perkapu". Will probably not compile.

Manual (in Hungarian) is included in the repository, videos created for its use are still available at my "channel" (https://www.youtube.com/@homokipeter).
