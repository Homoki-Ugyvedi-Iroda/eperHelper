This project is the *eperHelper*.
It was designed in 2016-2017 as a tool *to assist Hungarian lawyers in electronic court procedures* in Hungary, including 

a) use of a custom XML-based form filling software called √ÅNYK (General Form Filler) with roots dating back to 1998;

b) storing master data for clients, opposing parties, lawyers, other entities and minimum case data (number and court);

c) using an electronic signature creation tool developed by Microsec (eSzigno automated version);

d) facilitating upload of documents to "perkapu" (a special gateway for e-court communications);

e) archival and extracting of files, use of encryption keys for documents etc.

The tool was discontinued after 6 months due to lack of commercial interest (39 licenses bought at 16 900 HUF+VAT/each, cca. 50 euro/each).
